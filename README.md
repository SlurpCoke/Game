# **Summary**

**Game Name: King of the Pirates**

**Game Concept:**  As a rising pirate, you and your crew are constantly being challenged by other pirates who also want to become the king. Defend yourselves and attack the pirates and try to knock them out of their boats to become the king of the pirates\!

# **Gameplay** {#gameplay}

Our game progresses turn by turn. The initial turn will have player 1 shoot their bullet and it will either hit or miss the target. If it hits the target, it will knock it back while also decreasing its hp. Then if there is player 2, it will be their turn to shoot. After both player 1 and player 2 have gone, as long as the target is not knocked out or out of hp, it will be the targetâ€™s turn to shoot. This process repeats until either the target or the player is knocked out or out of hp.

The win condition is to hit the opposing pirates enough to either deplete their hp bar or to knock them out of their ship. 

The loss condition is missing more than the opposing pirates such that all players are either knocked out of their ships or depleted of hp before the enemies.

There are different difficulty levels. 

1. Rookie mode: Low enemy accuracy & available aiming cursor  
2. Pirate King mode: High enemy accuracy & no aiming cursor

So the controls would be only through mouse cursors. From start to end for the player, it will take turns between the player and the enemy shooting each other until one side is out of hp or knocked out. As soon as this happens, the game stops and declares a win or a loss. For the graphics, we will make our own character models as well as the different projectiles. Our game will rely heavily on the physics engine as we will have to use the collision logic for when the projectile collides with the enemy entity, but also to calculate where the projectile is going to land after getting launched.
